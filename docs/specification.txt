SECTION 1: Introduction, Vocabulary, Branding & Conventions

Purpleish, spelled exactly as written, is a color scheme.
The color scheme consists of a specification, a color list,
and many themes. Different color schemes have different vocabularies
and technical terms, Purpleish's unique vocabulary is specified
in this document. Regardless of what vocabulary is used
scientifically, all components of Purpleish should follow this
specification when possible.

The "COLOR SCHEME" refers to the whole software; all of Purpleish.

A "THEME" refers to an individual component of the full software
which integrates the colors of Purpleish into another
software.

The "SPECIFICATION" refers to the document in which the colors,
usage, and other components of Purpleish are defined.

A "COLOR," spelled exactly as written, has a specific hue,
saturation, and brightness. Colors do not have multiple shades,
each color has a specific brightness.

A "HUE" is what differentiates a set of colors when all said
colors have the same brightness and saturation.

The "BRIGHTNESS" of a color is how light or dark the color is.

The "SHADE" of a color is the same as its brightness. However,
the brightness is a specific measurement and unit, while a shade
is relative to another color and has no actual measurement.

The "saturation" is how vibrant or colorful a color is.

There may be instances in which a certain programming language or
configuration format uses different vocabulary that cannot be
adjusted or changed. In such case it is appropriate to use
different terms.

Purpleish is spelled as written and is capitalized differently
depending on the situation. Although the word "purplish" which
means "somewhat purple" is spelled differently, Purpleish has
its own unique speling.
