SECTION 1: Introduction, Vocabulary, Branding & Conventions

Purpleish, spelled exactly as written, is a color scheme. The color scheme
consists of a specification, a color list, and many themes. Different color
schemes have different vocabularies and technical terms, Purpleish's unique
vocabulary is specified in this document. Regardless of what vocabulary is used
scientifically, all components of Purpleish should follow this specification
when possible.

The "COLOR SCHEME" refers to the whole software; all of Purpleish.

A "THEME" refers to an individual component of the full software which
integrates the colors of Purpleish into another software.

The "SPECIFICATION" refers to the document in which the colors, usage, and
other components of Purpleish are defined.

A "COLOR," spelled exactly as written, has a specific hue, saturation, and
brightness. Colors do not have multiple shades, each color has a specific
brightness.

A "HUE" is what differentiates a set of colors when all said colors have the
same brightness and saturation.

The "BRIGHTNESS" of a color is how light or dark the color is.

The "SHADE" of a color is the same as its brightness. However, the brightness
is a specific measurement and unit, while a shade is relative to another color
and has no actual measurement.

The "SATURATION" is how vibrant or colorful a color is.

The "COLOR LIST" is a brief list of all the colors in this color scheme.

There may be instances in which a certain programming language or configuration
format uses different vocabulary that cannot be adjusted or changed. In such
cases, it is appropriate to use different terms. Purpleish is spelled as written
and is capitalized differently depending on the situation. Although the word
"purplish" which means "somewhat purple" is spelled differently, Purpleish has
its own unique spelling.

In urls, repository names, certain filenames, and similar cases, Purpleish is
fully lowercase.

In webpages, writing, logos, and other forms of "pretty-print" text, the first
letter of Purpleish is uppercase.

Certain programming languages, configuration formats, and writing styles
recommend specific casing styles. Purpleish source code should have the name
Purpleish written however the programming language or styleguide recommends.
However, the user-facing "pretty-print" output should adhere to the
specification, as explained above.

SECTION 2: Colors

Purpleish has a unique way of organizing its colors. There are hundreds of colors in Purpleish, but only a few colors have specific uses. The other colors exist for use cases that this specification has not thought of. This unique system of organizing colors helps keep consistency across different themes while making sure every possible use case has a color.

Purpleish uses HSB as its main system of organizing colors. HSB is the same as HSV, however, both are different from HSL.

Purpleish has 9 hues: 0°, 30°, 60°, 160°, 170°, 200°, 240°, 270°, and 320°.

Purpleish has 3 saturations: 20%, 40%, and 60%.

Purpleish has 10 brightnesses and shades: 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 100%.

In total there are 270 possible colors.

All 270 colors are listed below in various formats.
