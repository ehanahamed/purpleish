Chapter 1: Introduction, Vocabulary, Branding & Conventions

  Purpleish, spelled exactly as written, is a color scheme.
  The color scheme consists of a specification, a color list,
  and many themes. Different color schemes have different vocabulary
  and technical terms, Purpleish's unique vocabullary is specified
  in this document. Regardless of how such vocabullary is used
  scientifically, all components of Purpleish should follow this
  specification when possible.

    The "color scheme" refers to the whole software; all of Purpleish.

    A "theme" refers to an individual component of the full software,
    Purpleish, that integrates the colors of Purpleish into another
    software.

    The "specification" refers to the document in which the colors,
    usage, and other components of Purpleish are defined.

    A "color", spelled exactly as written, is a specific hue,
    saturation, and brightness. "Colors" do not have multiple shades,
    one "color" is a specific shade with a specific brightness.

    A "hue" is what differentiates a set of colors when all said
    colors have the same brightness and saturation.

    The "brightness" of a color is how light or dark the color is.

    The "saturation" is how vibrant or colorful a color is.

  There may be instances in which a certain programming language or
  configuration format uses different vocabullary that cannot be
  adjusted or changed.
